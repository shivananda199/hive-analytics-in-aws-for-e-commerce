# Project Setup on AWS

Follow the below steps to setup the project environment on AWS

### Create an AWS EC2 instance
Create a t2.2xlarge EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) with Storage equal to 96 GB and Allow ports in the range of 0-10000. While creating the instance, generate an RSA encrypted public and private key pair with the name __hive_docker_setup__. After successful instance creation, a PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) file will be generated by the name: **hive_docker_setup.pem**, download and save it in a secure place on your local machine. This file allows you to securely SSH into your instance. So, do not share this with anyone.
